# Red-Black Tree Dictionary

This C program implements a dictionary using a Red-Black Tree data structure. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to interact with the dictionary, allowing them to insert words or integers, search for words or integers, and display information about the tree such as size and height. The program supports two modes: one for inserting and searching integers and another for inserting and searching strings.

## Purpose

The purpose of this program is to showcase the implementation of a Red-Black Tree data structure as a dictionary. Red-Black Trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree that ensures the tree remains balanced, which helps maintain efficient search, insert, and delete operations. This program can be used as an educational tool to understand how Red-Black Trees work and how they can be applied to create a dictionary.

## Features

- Insert integers or strings into the Red-Black Tree.
- Search for integers or strings in the Red-Black Tree.
- Display the size (number of nodes) of the Red-Black Tree.
- Display the height of the Red-Black Tree.
- Display the Red-Black Tree in ascending order.

## GUI

The program features a text-based GUI that allows users to navigate through the menu using arrow keys and make selections using the Enter key. The GUI provides an intuitive way to interact with the Red-Black Tree dictionary.

## Usage

1. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Use the arrow keys to navigate the menu and the Enter key to make selections.
4. Select either the integer or string mode.
5. Perform operations such as inserting, searching, and displaying tree information as needed.
